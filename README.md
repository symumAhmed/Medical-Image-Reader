# Medical-Image-Reader
A research project based on a **custom built** medical image dataset and applying various **Deep Learning** Projects. The system takes a medical image as input, uses its training on the dataset and finds pattern to detect multiple types of diseases or medical issues. Initially the system has been developed for detecting Lung Diseases, Lung Cancer, Brain Tumors, Other tumors inside brain, Knee Osteoarthritis, Kidney Diseases (Stone, Cyst, Tumor) etc.

After collecting the images from their sources, we merged all the images into one dataset and divided them into 18 classes. Here is a snapshot of the classes:
